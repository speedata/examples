To get the PDF:

Run `sp` on the command line.

You can also generate the file `data.xml` yourself by running `sp --filter=tei2sp.lua` or renaming the config file to `publisher.cfg`. This invokes the Lua preprocessing for converting the TEI file to a less verbose data format.

The file `data.xml` is an intermediate file converted from the TEI source and provided for your convenience.
